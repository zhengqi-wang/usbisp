This is a fork from aleh/usbisp which is also a fork from USBASP.
I have a different version of USBISP by Zhifengsoft. 
The changes from the original USBASP are as follows.
1) remap the pin for D- from PB0 to PD3
2) remap the pin for LEDs, the USBISP has two alternatly working LEDs with located between PD5 and PD6
Known issue: only red LED is working.
